# Introduction

In this part I will present you two options for user interface. Both use Wayland.

## YouTube version of this tutorial

I recorded a YT series where I follow all of these instructions. The installation there is performed on a real-life hardware. Check it out if you get stuck.

[Secure ArchLinux Installation part 2 - User Interface with Sway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHe5dLoYYkI)

## GNOME

Just install gnome. This will get you the usuall, complete desktop expirience.

```
pacman -S gnome
```

Then go with all the default options, and enable systemD unit so it autostarts:

```
systemctl enable gdm.service
```

Reboot.


## Sway

Sway is a tiling window manager. It's like i3 but instead of Xorg it uses Wayland for display server protocol. From my expirience at this moment everything I need works, 
like screensharing on various platforms ( web google meet, teams, zoom ), and even Steam and GoG games.

For sway we need to install few extra packets:

```
pacman -S sway polkit swaybg waybar xorg-xwayland xdg-utils fakeroot pulseaudio
```

This basically gives you a starting base. You can start the UI manually with (but don't do that just yet):

```
sway
```

and personally I like to keep it that way. This means you will log via terminal and decide whether you want to jump into the UI or not.

Copy `config` file to your user's directory so you can enable your own changes:

```
mkdir .config/sway
cp /etc/sway/config .config/sway/
```

### Terminal

Install your preffered terminal emulator (foot, alacritty, whatever you want), I'm going to use alacritty for this example:

```
pacman -S alacritty
```

Then edit your config file and change terminal executable

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

# Your preferred terminal emulator
set $term alacritty
```

Now you can start `sway` and launch terminal by pressing `mod + Enter`

Personally I like my terminal windows a bit transparent, so let's do that:

```
mkdir ~/.config/alacritty/
vim ~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml

window:
  opacity: 0.75

```

Changes should be visible immediately.

### Popup command window

Create direcotory for your AUR repos and clone sway launcher there:

```
mkdir -p ~/repos/AUR/
cd ~/repos/AUR
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/sway-launcher-desktop.git
```

Install `fzf` dependency and font-awesome for icons, then build and install sway launcher:

```
cd sway-launcher-desktop
pacman -S fzf ttf-font-awesome
makepkg --install
```

Configure sway to start using that as our launcher:

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

set $menu dmenu_path | dmenu | xargs swaymsg exec -- # Comment out this line

# Put those lines below the commented out one
for_window [app_id="^launcher$"] floating enable, sticky enable, resize set 30 ppt 60 ppt, border pixel 10
set $menu exec $term --class=launcher -e /usr/bin/sway-launcher-desktop

```


### Status bar

Lot's of example are presented on the waybar github page https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Examples

The easiest way to start is to just grab an example and modify it to your needs.

Firt, create your waybar config directory:

```
mkdir ~/.config/waybar
```

Then, into that directory, download your choosen `config` and `style.css` files from the examples page.

We need to tell Sway to start using waybar, so edit your config file:

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

# Comment out or delete entire bar section
bar {
  (...)
}

# Put this
bar swaybar_command waybar
```

Reload Sway with `Shift + mod + c` to see your new status bar.

### Lockscreen

Never leave your station unlocked.

Install required packets:

```
pacman -S swaylock swayidle
```

Get yourself some nice lockscreen image and save it on your computer. I'll be reffering to mine as `~/Pictures/lockscreen.jpg`

Edit your sway config, the power off/on option will just turn off your display after longer period. Adjust the times (in seconds) as needed. The last option ensures our computer is locked upon entering suspended state.

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

exec swayidle -w \
         timeout 300 'swaylock -e -f -i ~/Pictures/lockscreen.jpg' \
         timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * power off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * power on"' \
         before-sleep 'swaylock -e -f -i ~/Pictures/lockscreen.jpg'
```

Add option for manual locking, in my case I'm going for `mod + L`, same as on Windows:

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

### Key bindings
#
# Basics:
#
    # Lock screen
    bindsym $mod+l exec swaylock -e -f -i ~/Pictures/lockscreen.jpg -C ~/.config/swaylock/config
```

This keystroke collides with another one, so comment them out. Don't worry, you can still change focus with arrow keys:

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

# Comment those out:
#bindsym $mod+$left focus left
#bindsym $mod+$down focus down
#bindsym $mod+$up focus up
#bindsym $mod+$right focus right
```

### Background

Same as with lockscreen, get yourself nice wallpaper and save it to `~/Pictures/bg.png`

Then change the path in sway's config file:

```
vim ~/.config/sway/config

### Output configuration
#
# Default wallpaper (more resolutions are available in /usr/share/backgrounds/sway/)
output * bg ~/Pictures/bg.png fill
```
